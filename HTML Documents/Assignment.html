		<h3>German Shepherd History</h3>
		<p> From 'THE DOG PEOPLE' by Rover.com:
		<blockquote cite="https://www.rover.com/blog/breeds/german-shepherd/.html">
			<p>"The ancestors of German Shepherds were bred in late 19th century Germany as working dogs, specifically as sheepdogs and guard dogs on farms. In 1899, after much disagreement about which qualities to highlight in the breed, Max von Stephanitz declared the first German Shepherd dog, which he named Horand von Grafrath."</p>
